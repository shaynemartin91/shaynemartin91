### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shayne (He/Him)! I'm the Tech Lead & Engineering Manager of Volunteer Training @ Crisis Text Line. You can also find me over on [Polywork](https://www.polywork.com/shaynemartin). 

I am currently working on an integrated training environment for Crisis Counselors at Crisis Text Line. Our intent is to improve volunteer training and their confidence on the platform, resulting in a better experience for texters. I care deeply about **people** and how systems and technology affect them. My goal is to create a positive and equitable future. Black and Trans Lives Matter! âœŠ
