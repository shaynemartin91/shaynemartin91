### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shayne (He/Him)! I'm a Staff Software Engineer @ [Crisis Text Line](https://crisistextline.org) supporting people in crisis. You can also find me over on [Polywork](https://www.polywork.com/shaynemartin). 

I care deeply about **people** and how systems and technology affect them. My goal is for my work to create a positive and equitable future. Black and Trans Lives Matter! âœŠ

I like to code, watch Bluey with my kids, pretend to know what I'm doing while playing Destiny 2, watch the bunnies, deer and hawks in my backyard, scroll endlessly through TikTok, cry at every Disney movie, hyper-fixate on a new hobby every month.
